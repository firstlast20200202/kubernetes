Cluster architecture of Kubernetes:
Master: 
ETCD cluster
kube-apiserver
kube Controller Manager
kube-scheduler

Worker Notes:
kubelet
Kube-proxy


Docker vs ContainerD:
we run containers using the run commands:
commands of ContainerD: 
CLI-ctr: limited functions, better for debugging
CLI-nerdctl: similar to Docker CLI

commands of Kubernetes: 
crictl: limited functions, better for debugging (kubelet doesnt recognise crictl commands, it would delete them, that's why it can be used for debugging purposes only)


ETCD commands:
default version is rtcdctl veersion: 3.3  API version: 2  command would be: ./etcdctl set key1 value1
upgrade version by ETCDCTL_API=3 ./etcdctl version  then in API version 3 command would be ./etcdctl put key1 value1


Kube-Scheduler decides which pod goes on which node, kubelet creates the pod and places the pod on the node
