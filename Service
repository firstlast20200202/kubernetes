3 types of services:
NodePort
Cluster IP
Loadbalancer

Yaml file of NodePort type:  
apiVersion: v1
kind: services
metadata:
  name: myapp-service

spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - targetPort: 80
      port: 80            //mandatory field
      nodePort: 30008      //auto-distribute if not filled in
  selector:                //links the service to the pod
      app: myapp
      type: front-end

once done the yaml file, 
create the service: kubectl create -f service-definition.yml
kubectl get services

use this pod to access to the web service:
> curl http://192.168.1.2:30008


The way to make service linking to multiple pods, is to make these two fields the same:
selector:        //of service
  app: myapp


labels:        //of pods
  app: myapp
