Deamon sets are replica of pods, when a node is removed, daemon set in the node is auto-removed as well

use cases of daemon sets:
monitoring solution
logs viewer
kube-proxy
weave-net


daemon-set-definition.yaml file is similar to replicaset-definition.yaml
it has 'selector' which links to pods as well as pods specification 'templates', make sure that the 'app' in these two fileds are the same.


How does it work?
Uses NodeAffinity and default sceduler to locate to different nodes


To create a daemonset, since there's no 'kubectl create daemonset' command, we can create a deployment first, and get into the yaml file, then 
update 'kind' to 'DaemonSet', delete 'replicas', 'strategy' and 'status' fields.
>kubectl create deployment elasticsearch -n kube-system --image=registry.k8s.io/fluentd-elasticsearch:1.20 --dry-run=client -o yaml
>kubectl create deployment elasticsearch -n kube-system --image=registry.k8s.io/fluentd-elasticsearch:1.20 --dry-run=client -o yaml > fluentd.yaml
>vi fluentd.yaml 
>kubectl create -f fluentd.yaml
