Deamon sets are replica of pods, when a node is removed, daemon set in the node is auto-removed as well

use cases of daemon sets:
monitoring solution
logs viewer
kube-proxy
weave-net


daemon-set-definition.yaml file is similar to replicaset-definition.yaml
it has 'selector' which links to pods as well as pods specification 'templates', make sure that the 'app' in these two fileds are the same.
