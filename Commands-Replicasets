kubectl explain replicaset
output would be explaining each part in the yaml file, notice that the first part is as below which means that the version should be apps/v1 
(counterpart in replicate controller is 'v1')
GROUP:      apps
KIND:       ReplicaSet
VERSION:    v1


kubectl get crds  //custom recource definition (add-ons / extension of kubernetes)
kubectl ap  //output is the selective commands which start with 'ap'
kubectl api-resources  //output is all the objects defined in kubernetes (including 'kind' in the last column)
kubectl api-resources | grep rs  //filter the output which include the word 'rs'


question: Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image. Either delete and recreate the ReplicaSet or update 
the existing ReplicaSet and then delete all PODs, so new ones with the correct image will be created. If you opt to delete the ReplicaSet and 
recreate it, please refer to the file named new-replica-set.yaml, which is saved in the /root/ directory for your convenience and fix it.
kubectl edit rs new-replica-set
after updating the image, gotta manually delete all the pods and it will auto-creates new ones
kubectl delete pod pod-1 pod-2 pod-3 pod-4 ...


question: Scale the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs. Use kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.
kubectl scale rs new-replica-set --replicas=5
kubectl get pods

solution 2: edit in this part
kubectl edit replicaset new-replica-set
spec:
  replicas: 5
