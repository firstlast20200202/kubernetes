deployment-definition.yml (contents are exactly simialr to the replicaset definition file except 'kind')
apiVersion: app/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
  labels:
    app: myapp
    type: front-end
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
        app: myapp
        type: front-end
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: nginx-container
          image: nginx
replicas: 3
selector:
  matchlabels:
    type: front-end

Once the file is ready, run commands:
kubectl create -f deployment-definition.yml
kubectl get deployments  //a deployment auto-creates a replicaset
kubectl get replicaset  //a replicaset auto-creates pods
kubectl get pods
kubectl get all  //get all the created objects at once


when debug, can get into details of one of the pods as below:
kubectl describe <pod-name>


when dont know the commands, can do it as below:
kubectl create deployment --help
then can get this eg.
kubectl create deployment httd-frontend --image=httpd:2.4-alpine --replicas=3
