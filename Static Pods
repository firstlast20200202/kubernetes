Static pods are configured in this folder here: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
and the location of that directory is passed as an option while running the service:
kubelet.service
--pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests  \\

another way to configure this:
kubelet.service
--config=kubeconfig.yaml  \\

kubeconfig.yaml
StaticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests

Once static pods are created, they can be viewed by:
>docker ps


The path to find this file is: cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml


Question: Create a static pod named static-busybox that uses the busybox image , run in the default namespace and the command sleep 1000
>kubectl run static-busybox --image=busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml --command -- sleep 1000
>kubectl run static-busybox --image=busybox --dry-run=client -o yaml --command -- sleep 1000 > static-busybox.yaml
>cp static-busybox.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/    //move the file to this folder
>kubectl get pods     //verify


Question: We just created a new static pod named static-greenbox. Find it and delete it.
>kubectl get pods -A
>kubectl delete pod static-greenbox-node01
>kubectl get pods -A    
//by now findout that the pod is still existing because 'kubectl delete' doesnt work for statis pods, it will be re-created again
The correct way is as below:
controlplane ~ ➜ ls /etc/kubernetes/manifests/    //there's no related yaml file in controlplane node
controlplane ~ ➜ kubectl get nodes -o wide      //the pod is in another node node01
controlplane ~ ➜ ssh 192.168.219.134
node01 ~ ➜ ls /etc/kubernetes/manifests/    //there's no yaml file in this folder
node01 ~ ➜ ls /var/lib/kubelet/    //to find the static pod path in the yaml file    
node01 ~ ➜ cat config.yaml      //in the file it shows: staticPodPath: /etc/just-to-mess-with-you
node01 ~ ➜ ls /etc/just-to-mess-with-you    //it shows greenbox.yaml in the folder
node01 ~ ➜ rm /etc/just-to-mess-with-you/greenbox.yaml    //remove the file
node01 ~ ➜ ls /etc/just-to-mess-with-you    //verify there's no file in this folder
node01 ~ ➜ exit    //exit this node
controlplane ~ ➜
